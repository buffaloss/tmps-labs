------
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Study and understand the Creational Design Patterns.__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. Choose a domain, define its main classes/models/entities and choose the appropriate instantiation mechanisms.__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Use some creational design patterns for object instantiation in a sample project.__

## Some Theory:
&ensp; &ensp; Creational design patterns are a type of design pattern that focuses on the process of creating an object. They enable the production of objects in a flexible and controlled manner, while divorcing client code from object creation specifics. Creational design patterns address basic difficulties in object creation, such as how to generate objects with varied initialization values, how to create objects depending on particular criteria, or how to create just one instance of an object. There are various creational design patterns, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Each of them is better suited to handling certain object production difficulties. Developers may increase the flexibility, maintainability, and scalability of their programs by employing creational design patterns.

&ensp; &ensp; The design patterns implemented in this project are:

   * Singleton
   * Builder
   * Prototype
   * Factory Method
   
## Main tasks:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Choose an OO programming language and a suitable IDE or Editor (No frameworks/libs/engines allowed).__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. Select a domain area for the sample project.__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Define the main involved classes and think about what instantiation mechanisms are needed.__

&ensp; &ensp; __4. Based on the previous point, implement at least 2 creational design patterns in your project.__
